Methods for parsing/plotting Quantum Espresso/SGW output files.
Briefly the module contains functions for pulling band structure
data from Quantum Espresso output files, self-energy data,
and dielectric data from SGW output files.

There are also routines for easily generating and varying
input files for Quantum Espresso and SGW calculations.
